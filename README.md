# ProtVista

A Web Component which uses [Nightingale](https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/nightingale) components to display protein sequence information.

**Branching model and v5**

> - **`main` (this branch)** is the current-major **4.x** production line. Published on npm as `protvista-uniprot`; custom element `<protvista-uniprot>`. Receives non-breaking changes (security, performance, dependencies, CI). Use this for production.
> - **[`next`](../../tree/next)** is the **v5** development line. It carries any breaking changes that come out of the [SSI RSMF](ROADMAP.md) work: a configuration-driven loader, a published JSON-Schema for viewer configurations, a declarative tooltip resolver.`v5` will rename the package and element to `protvista`. GitHub has already been renamed and the old URL auto-redirects, and `protvista-uniprot` will remain on npm as a deprecated alias once v5 ships. **Schemas and APIs on `next` are still evolving — do not depend on them in production yet.** Targeted production release: early 2027.

## Browser Support

This component requires a modern browser with support for [ES2021](https://caniuse.com/?search=ES2021) and [Web Components (Custom Elements v1)](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1).

| Browser | Minimum version |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Chrome  | 92+             |
| Edge    | 92+             |
| Firefox | 90+             |
| Safari  | 15+             |

Older browsers are not supported.

## Usage

### Use within an HTML file

Create an [ES module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) import within a static HTML file:

```html
<script type="module" src="./protvista-uniprot.mjs"></script>
```

Then display the component:

```html
<protvista-uniprot accession="P05067"></protvista-uniprot>
```

### Importing as a module

```js
import ProtvistaUniprot from 'protvista-uniprot';

window.customElements.define('protvista-uniprot', ProtvistaUniprot);
```

You can then use it like this:

```html
<protvista-uniprot accession="P05067"></protvista-uniprot>
```

## API

- `accession`: `string`
- `config?`: `Object` (see [Configuration](#configuration))
- `config-src?`: `string` — URL of a JSON viewer configuration (see [Configuration](#configuration))
- `nostructure?`: `boolean` (default: `false`)

## Development

Run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

to install dependencies and start the local development server.

## Testing

Tests run under [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with a `jsdom` DOM environment. All APIs (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`, …) must be imported explicitly from `'vitest'` — `globals` is off.

```bash
# Run the full pipeline (lint + types + unit)
yarn test

# Unit tests only (CI-friendly, non-zero exit on failure)
yarn test:unit

# Watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Coverage (writes text + html + lcov to ./coverage/)
yarn test:coverage
```

Coverage output is for local use only and is not committed. Open `coverage/index.html` after `yarn test:coverage` to inspect.

### Continuous integration

Every push and pull request runs the same checks as `yarn test` via [`.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml`](./.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml): `yarn test:lint`, `yarn test:types`, `yarn test:unit`, plus `yarn test:coverage` against the thresholds defined in `vite.config.mjs`. All steps run under Node 24 on `ubuntu-latest`. A separate `build` job runs `yarn build` (and, on `main`, `yarn build:demo`) and deploys the demo to GitHub Pages.

### Coverage

Coverage thresholds live in [`vite.config.mjs`](./vite.config.mjs) under `test.coverage.thresholds` and follow a ratchet pattern — they only ever go up. CI fails if a change drops coverage below the recorded threshold. Run `yarn test:coverage` locally to see the current numbers, or `yarn test:coverage:ratchet` to lift the thresholds to match the latest run (commit the resulting `vite.config.mjs` change in the same PR as the coverage improvement).

## Performance benchmarks

A `bench/` workflow captures repeatable performance baselines for the demo across three layers: library bundle size, Lighthouse CI against a fixed set of UniProt scenarios, and DOM-observed custom milestones (`fetch-and-parse`, `render`, `total`). Run `yarn bench` to produce `bench/results/summary.md`. Reference snapshots live under `bench/baselines/` and are committed; per-run output is gitignored.

See [`bench/README.md`](./bench/README.md) for scenarios, capture procedure, and methodology notes.

## Configuration

ProtVista mounts categories and tracks dynamically from a viewer
configuration. There are two ways to supply your own:

- **`config-src` attribute** (no code): point the component at a JSON file.
  The file is validated against the published
  [configuration schema](./schema/protvista-config.schema.json); on failure
  every problem is reported on the console and the viewer falls back to the
  default UniProt configuration.

  ```html
  <protvista-uniprot
    accession="P05067"
    config-src="./config.json"
  ></protvista-uniprot>
  ```

- **`config` property** (JavaScript): assign a configuration object directly.
  A validator is exported for programmatic use:

  ```js
  import { validateConfig, formatConfigErrors } from 'protvista-uniprot';
  ```

The full contract — including the distinction between the **viewer
configuration** (owned by ProtVista) and **track payloads** (owned by data
providers/adapters) — is documented in
[docs/configuration.md](./docs/configuration.md). The menu colours default
to the UniProt Franklin palette and can be rethemed via `--protvista-*` CSS
custom properties (see the Theming section there).

To visualise your own data without writing any code, start from the
[Starter Kit](./starter-kit/): an HTML page, a sample configuration, and a
local data folder you can copy and edit.

## Events

A custom `protvista-event` is emitted:

- When at least one of the tracks returns data

Example event detail:

```js
detail: {
  hasData: true;
}
```

## Publishing

```bash
npm login
rm -rf node_modules dist
yarn
yarn build
yarn publish
git push
```
